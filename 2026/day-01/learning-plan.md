# My 90-Day DevOps + Cloud Learning Plan (2026)

## Where I am right now
I’m a fresher / early DevOps learner. I have started practicing Linux, Git/GitHub, Docker, and Terraform basics.  
I’m also following TrainWithShubham DevOps Bootcamp and building real projects to learn faster.

## What DevOps and Cloud mean to me
DevOps is about shipping software faster and more safely using automation and good teamwork.  
Cloud means running apps on servers/services like AWS in a scalable and secure way, instead of relying only on local machines.

## Why I’m learning DevOps + Cloud
- I want a strong career in DevOps / Cloud roles.
- I want to become confident in real troubleshooting (not just tutorials).
- I want a public GitHub portfolio that shows my discipline and skills.

## Where I want to reach in 90 days
By the end of 90 days, I want to be able to:
- Deploy an application like a real company (Docker + Kubernetes).
- Build a CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions or Jenkins) that automatically builds and deploys.
- Use Terraform to create cloud infrastructure in a clean and reusable way.

## My 3 goals for the next 90 days
1. **Linux + troubleshooting**  
   I want to diagnose and fix issues like disk full, high CPU, memory problems, permissions, and network errors.
2. **Docker + CI/CD**  
   I want to build good Docker images (multi-stage, small size) and run apps with Compose, then automate with CI/CD.
3. **Kubernetes + Terraform (cloud-ready)**  
   I want to deploy apps on Kubernetes and provision infrastructure using Terraform with remote state and basic security.

## The 3 skills I will focus on the most
- Linux + Networking troubleshooting (systemd/journalctl, logs, DNS, ports)
- CI/CD pipelines + Docker best practices
- Kubernetes debugging + Terraform infrastructure

## My weekly time plan (realistic)
- Weekdays: **2 hours per day**
- Weekends: **4–5 hours per day**
Total: around **18–20 hours per week**

## How I will stay consistent (most important)
- Every day: **1 task + 1 commit**
- For each day, I will keep proof in the repo:
  - what I learned (notes)
  - commands I used
  - important output / screenshots (if needed)
- If I miss a day: I will not quit — I will do **2 tasks the next day** and continue.

## What I want to have at the end (Day 90)
A GitHub repo that clearly shows:
- Day-by-day learning notes
- Strong troubleshooting practice
- One complete capstone project deployed using CI/CD + Docker + Kubernetes + Terraform
